  "content": "Real-time gesture recognition has become an essential component in modern human-computer interaction systems. Using OpenCV and MediaPipe, developers can build intelligent vision-based applications that interpret human hand gestures for controlling software interfaces.\n\n## Computer Vision Pipeline\n\nA typical real-time gesture system involves video frame capture, landmark detection using MediaPipe, feature extraction, and classification using machine learning algorithms. Efficient preprocessing and tracking are key to maintaining performance.\n\n## Application Areas\n\nGesture-based systems are used in accessibility tools, touchless interfaces, and AI-powered educational platforms. These systems can also be extended for sign language recognition and robotic control.\n\n## Challenges\n\nHandling latency, lighting conditions, and gesture variability remains a major challenge. Optimization of frame processing is essential for maintaining accuracy and responsiveness.",
